## Overview

The External Access Service is designed to:

* Provide a unified entry point for external clients to access EPOS resources.
* Ensure secure and authenticated interactions with EPOS services.
* Facilitate interoperability between EPOS and external systems.

---

## Features

* **Secure Access**: Implements authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect EPOS resources.
* **Standardized Interfaces**: Exposes RESTful APIs for consistent interaction patterns.
* **Integration Ready**: Designed to be easily integrated with other services within the EPOS infrastructure and external systems.

---

## Architecture

The External Access Service is built using Java and Spring Boot, following a microservices architecture. It leverages standard security protocols to ensure secure communication and data protection.

**Components:**

* **API Layer**: Handles incoming HTTP requests and routes them to the appropriate service components.
* **Service Layer**: Contains the business logic for processing access requests and interactions.
* **Security Layer**: Manages authentication and authorization processes.
